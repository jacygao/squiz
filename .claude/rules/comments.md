# Comments

The code says what it does. A comment adds what it is for, and why.

## Do

- Keep a comment only if removing it makes something ambiguous or dangerous.
  That rules out restating a name, a type, or a file header, and commenting
  boilerplate: getters, wiring, config. When a rule here does not cover the
  case in front of you, apply that test.
- Update or delete the comment above code you change. One that outlived its code
  is worse than none, because it still reads as true.
- Turn an open question into a GitHub issue, cited by number. Never `// TODO`.
  A comment that turns out to be false is a finding, not a tidy-up.
- One line by default. Go longer only to answer a question the code around it
  does not.
- Open with a sentence saying what the code is for. The why is the body, where
  there is one. A noun phrase names the topic and leaves the reader to infer
  the claim.
- Short sentences, ordinary words, no stacked clauses.
- State the claim, then anchor it. A pointer with no claim is a broken link; a
  claim with no pointer cannot be verified.
- Put `//` on the line directly above the code it explains, not in a paragraph
  at the top of the block.
- Use `/** */` for a module's purpose, a function's contract, or a reason needing
  more than one line.
- Make three or more items a bulleted list, not one sentence.
- Comment a test for a fixture whose shape is not obvious, for why the test
  exists at all, or for the spec clause it pins. A regression test names what
  regressed, by issue number. Test names and assertion messages are output
  rather than comments: a reason that belongs in the failure goes in the
  assertion message, where the run prints it.

## Never

- Say a thing twice in one file. A rule stated on the module and again on the
  method has one of them wrong from the first edit that touches either.
- Record current state ("three adapters", "M4 not built"). That belongs in
  `docs/specs/` or `docs/notes/`.
- Reproduce an argument a spec already makes. Give the one-line claim and the
  anchor, not the reasoning.
- Cite a spec by number. Heading, never `§ 7`. The rest of the repository does
  cite by H2 number — the specification's own cross-references, a note's
  `settles` field, a subagent's brief — and code is the deliberate exception. A
  section renumbers, and the comment three files away does not renumber with it.
  A heading also greps.

## Reference: what to anchor with

```ts
/**
 * Findings that could not be posted go to stderr as one line, not as a report.
 * A second output format is the thing this must not become.
 * (review-harness-spec, "The hook's stderr")
 */
```

- Specs by file and heading: `review-harness-spec`, "Pull request comments".
  Quote the part that greps: a heading carrying inline code,
  ``### The `pi` adapter``, is cited as ``"The `pi` adapter"``, backticks and
  all, because that is the string in the file.
- Notes by filename: `docs/notes/cost-arrives-during-a-run.md`.
- Rules by path: `.claude/rules/comments.md`.
- Issues by number: `#12`.

## Reference: what belongs at each level

- **Class or module**: why it exists, and the constraints it must obey.

  ```ts
  /**
   * Every failure path here exits 0. The harness may fail in any way except by
   * preventing the coding agent from finishing, so a throw that escapes this
   * module is the one bug it cannot have.
   * (review-harness-spec, "Failure modes")
   */
  ```

- **Method**: the contract. Any failure mode or constraint the caller must know.

  ```ts
  /**
   * Post the finding as a thread on the changed line it was anchored to.
   *
   * Resolves false when GitHub refuses the anchor, which it does for any line
   * outside the diff. The caller reports the finding as general instead.
   * Not an error.
   */
  ```

- **Variable**: only a surprising value, or a constraint on it. A variable that
  needs a summary has a bad name. Rename, do not comment.

  ```ts
  // Under the runtime's hook timeout, which kills the round with nothing posted.
  const REVIEW_BUDGET_SECONDS = 420;
  ```

- **Code logic**: why this branch does what it does, never what it does. A
  branch that looks unreachable or removable is the case that most needs one.

  ```ts
  // Bad: restates the code.
  // Loop over the threads
  for (const thread of threads) {
  ```

  ```ts
  // Good: the why, and what it obeys.
  // A thread the reviewer returned no verdict for is treated as open.
  for (const thread of threads) {
  ```
